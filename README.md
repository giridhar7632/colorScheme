# Color Scheme Generator

This workshop is an introduction to [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). We're building a colorful app - 'random-color scheme generator' using react. It will look something like this.

Here's the [Live demo](https://color-scheme-generator.giridharhackclu.repl.co/) and [Source Code](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/Color-scheme-generator#src/index.js)

## Prerequisites

Before staring this workshop, you should have some knowledge about [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and some ES6 features of JavaScript.

- React Fundamentals
  - [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
  - [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
  - [State and LifeCycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
  
 If you are familar with these, Lets get going.

## Setup

For setting up the project fork this repl [here](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/color-scheme-generator-starter#README.md). The starter repl contains ['create-react-app'](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) installed. There are some basic styles applied, you will get cleared along the workshop.

Lets start React

## React Hooks API

[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are introduced in React 16.8 version. Previously, [class (stateful)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react/) components were the only way to define a component that had its own state, and lifecycle methods. We cannot use state in [functional (stateless)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react/) components of React. Hooks enables us to use state and other React features without writing a [class (stateful)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react/) component.
