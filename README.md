# Color Scheme Generator

This workshop is an introduction to [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). We're building a colorful app - 'random-color scheme generator' using react. It will look something like this.

Here's the [Live demo](https://color-scheme-generator.giridharhackclu.repl.co/) and [Source Code](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/Color-scheme-generator#src/index.js)

## Prerequisites

Before staring this workshop, you should have some knowledge about [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and some ES6 features of JavaScript.

- React Fundamentals
  - [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
  - [Components and Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
  - [State and LifeCycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
  
 If you are familar with these, Lets get going.

## Setup

For setting up the project fork this repl [here](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/color-scheme-generator-starter#README.md). The starter repl contains ['create-react-app'](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) installed. There are some basic styles applied, you will get cleared along the workshop.

Lets start React

## React Hooks API

[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are introduced in React 16.8 version. Previously, [class](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react/) components were the only way to define a component that had its own state, and lifecycle methods. [Functional](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react/) components of React, which are light and more flexible, are limited in functionality. Hooks enables us to use state and other React features, like lifecycle methods and event handlers,  without writing a [class](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react/) component. 

There are many benifits of using Functional components. They are :
* Easier to read, test and debug.
* Have better performance.
* More reusable.
